A Python server & client.
The main functionality is a groupchat. Once a new client joins they can pick a username and send a message for everyone connected to see.
They can also use the "/w Name Message" command to send a private message, the "\n Name" to change their name (name must be unique), and "/l" to see a list of all connected users.
